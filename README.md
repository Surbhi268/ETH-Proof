# ETHEREUM-Beginner Assessment - Getting Started with Solidity
In this, I will be sharing about what I learned from this course with the help of token project given by metacrafters team.
## Description
Here this Solidity contract named surbhiFirstToken that defines a token called Solana (Sol) with an initial total supply of 0 tokens. This contract provides functionality to mint new tokens to a specified address and burn tokens from a specified address, ensuring the integrity of token balances.
### Code execution
For executing the code i have used remix ide [https://remix.ethereum.org/].

### Code Explanation
In this Solidity contract for a token called "Solana" (abbreviated "Sol") with a total initial supply of 0 tokens. The contract includes functions for minting and burning tokens, and it keeps track of token balances using a mapping from address to uint.

#### Execution steps on remix ide online
=> Click on compile.

=> Must check whether the compiler version set according to your code.

=> Now go to deploy and transact section for giving inputs and click on transact after adding inputs the account.

=> After this your deployed contracts will be at the bottom.
